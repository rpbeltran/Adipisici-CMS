Adipisici CMS
===

An API-First Content Management System.

Current Version: 0.0.1


Why this?
===

Content Management Systems are all that stand between developers and static files.
Great, but most of the time, a CMS takes it too far for many users.

Some problems with a traditional CMS:
 * They force you to use their front end tools. A WYSIWYG can only take you so far.
 * They force you to deal with their bloat. A traditional CMS will have you serving up all sorts of crap that you aren't using. This means longer page loads (correlated to fewer conversions), and greater server costs.
 * Nothing is tailor made for your application.

These are not problems for everybody. For people without a background in web design, a WYSIWYG is empowering, not limiting. But some people want to be in control.

Adipisici CMS is a project to make a CMS that does what a Content Management System should do.. manage content. It is completely impartial to the rest of your stack.

Adipisici CMS uses:
 * Node.js - for server side scripting
 * MongoDB - for storing content
 * Git - for creating integrated version control
 * NPM - for package management and installation

The goal of Adipisici is to provide a developer friendly, REST API Content Management System that allows you to build websites, mobile apps, and more around your content.

We don't pretend to know what your content is going to look like, nor do we think we could possibly know what on earth you're doing with it, but if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
