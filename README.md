Adipisici CMS
===

A RESTful, decoupled, and API-First Content Management System designed to provide an impartial and developer friendly backend environment that allows developers to easily build web applications, mobile apps, and more around your content. 
Adipisici was built on the premise that the content layer should be decoupled from the rendering layer.

Why this?
===

Content Management Systems are all that stand between developers and static files, but often a CMS takes it too far.

Some problems with a traditional CMS:
 * They force you to use their front end tools. A WYSIWYG can only take you so far, and even designing custom templates you are still limited in what technologies you can use.
 * They force you to deal with their bloat. A traditional CMS will have you serving up all sorts of crap that you aren't using. This means longer page loads (correlated to fewer conversions), and greater server costs.
 * Nothing is tailor made for your application.

These are not problems for everybody. For people without a background in web design, a WYSIWYG is empowering, not limiting. But some people want or need to be in greater control.

Adipisici CMS is designed to manage content, while remaining completely impartial to the rest of your stack.

**Development**

Adipisici is still under development, and may be for a while. It is not yet ready for production use, though has already been used effectively for creating demos, and non-production code, typically at hackathons, and the experience using it has been amazing so far. Breaking changes can be expected to occur frequently and unanounced until release of 1.x
